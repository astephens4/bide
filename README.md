*CLI D*evelopment Environment - For the developer with something to prove.

This is really just a bunch of template files and scripts to remove monotony from remedial tasks.
Development environment? Sure.
Integrated? Nah.

Initial Commit:
First commit includes the main makefile templates. Overall project makefile still needs work.
All of the scripts need to be made.
