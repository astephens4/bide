How I imagine the experience:

Features to consider:
Download and install toolchains
Integration with version control systems

To create a new project:

user@computer:cwd$ bide-mkproj PROJECT_NAME

    - PROJECT_NAME does not include spaces or special characters
    - the PROJECT_NAME directory does not have to exist yet, but it can
        * If dir/PROJECT_NAME exists, no files will be deleted
    - This creates the following files/directories
        * PROJECT_NAME/Makefile
        * PROJECT_NAME/common/makeinclude.default
        * PROJECT_NAME/common/makeinclude.test
        * PROJECT_NAME/doc
    - This will spawn a series of simple questions:
        1. Toolchains?
            * Lists available toolchains and option to add a new toolchain
            * After each toolchain selection, ask user if they would like to alias it
                - Ex. toolchain name is bcm2651-gcc, alias to raspi. Allows the user to type "make raspi" instead of "make bcm2651-gcc"
            * Select the default build target after all selections were made
        2. Build out of source or in source?
